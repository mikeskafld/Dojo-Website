## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js 15 project with React 19
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
- Marketing pages are in app/(marketing)/ route group
- Authenticated pages are in app/(authenticated)/ route group
- Uses Supabase for backend (auth + database)
- Uses Radix UI for accessible components
- Uses 'motion' library (Framer Motion) for animations
- Existing components in /components/ui/ follow shadcn/ui patterns
